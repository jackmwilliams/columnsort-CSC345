This program implements the columnsort sorting algorithm, which utilizes
a two-dimensional matrix and an eight-step process to sort a list of numbers.
The key runnable source file is Prog3.java, which can be found in src/AS3.
The program accepts a text file of numbers as a command-line input, with the
.dat files in the same directory provided as sample input.
The program, when run, outputs the sorted list to the command line, as well as
the amount of time taken in milliseconds.

(Please note that, because of how the algorithm works, the program is more efficient with
a composite number of input data items, which allows for a more evenly distributed matrix.)
